//GAME
//requirements: Build a game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
//outline: memory game with 8 cards that needs to you match anime characters from the same show
//features: shows randomised anime gif when you win; displays result; displays highscore (for as long as you don't exit the game)

//steps:
//understanding the problem: what is it asking you to do? whatâ€™s the input and the output?
// -> create a game that lets a user interact with the website, and which takes their input, evaluates it, stores it, and displays results
// -> input: user clicks / output: game results
//write pseudocode: break problem down into key steps; use JavaScript comments
// -> write html for rough framework according to wireframe
// -> write css for rough framework according to wireframe (very rough!)
// -> break jss functionality down into small functions
// -> when functionality works, refine html and css
//write JS for each step following the pseudocode (console.log() to check code at each step)
//refactor: how can you change your code to make it more efficient? how might you solve the problem differently?
